<span class="fc2">W</span>hen it comes to modifying cars there is plenty of things you could do, get new wheels, a spoiler, maybe some coilovers? The point i am trying to make is there is a lot of different ways you could modify your car and your options are endless, especially when it comes to japanese classics such as Mazda rx7's, mitsubishi lancer's, lexus ls400's, toyota chasers and many more. Because they have been out on the market for such a long time there is plenty of companys that create custom parts for such cars, below you can find some of my favourite customized nissan R32's.
