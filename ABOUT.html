<span class="fc2">T</span>he R32 GTR and how it became the "GODZILLA". The first ever GTR was released in 1969 and produced until 1972, powered by a 2.0L 160bhp inline-six engine it was quite a car to have when it was first released, infact it was so well recieved that in 1973 nissan released the second generation GTR, only releasing 197 during its short production run. This was not enough but before anyone got to see another version of the GTR it took 16 years, this is where we first see the R32 GTR. Equipped with a 2.6l inline six engine it produced 280bhp while the car weighed just 3100lb. The GTR took part in Group A racing and dominated the stage, winning all 29 races of the Japanese Touring Car Championship, it also won the 1991 Spa 24 Hour race and was taking part in australian championships too where it was named "GODZILLA" by the austrialian press once it dominated all of its austrialian competitors by a big margin.
